**Computer music stimulation of human creativity: techno-musicking as lab for inner and outer worlding**

Various convincing evolutionary theories across science and humanities posit a central role for musicking in the evolution of social, biological and technical patterns of modern humanity. In our contemporary milieu - one of existential, ecological etc. crises - musical experimentation plays a similarly critical role in providing a free and fertile space for making sense of the world, ourselves and our emerging technologies. In this talk I’ll share a range of projects from singing cybernetic homeostats and ecosystemic evolutionary art, through feedback cellos to acoustic biodiversity assessment to illustrate some of the ways that techno-musicking plays a creative role in ways of knowing and making our selves and our worlds.

[Dr. Alice Eldridge](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p127749-alice-eldridge) is interested in how sound organises systems. Her research cross-fertilises ideas and methods from music, cognitive science, technology & ecology to develop biologically-inspired approaches to new musical instruments, and acoustic methods for conservation, within the emerging science of ecoacoustics. She holds a BSc in Psychology, an MSc in Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems and a PhD in Computer Science and AI and is currently Lecturer in Music Technology at the University of Sussex, where she is Co-Director of the Sussex Humanities Lab. Alice has appeared on BBC TV and BBC 4 as a soundscape ecologist; on BBC 3 as a free jazz cellist; on BBC 6 show as a contemporary chamber composer; and on BBC 1 John Peel show as a pop bassist.

[Professor Emeritus Dr. Johan Sundberg](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UXXUEcoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), 
**Analysis by synthesis: A wonderful tool in difficult areas**

Analysis by synthesis is a classical tool in many areas of research. I will talk about how I enjoyed using it in three research areas. In one, Björn Lindblom and I applied it in a study of the compositional style in nursery tunes composed by the Swedish composer Alice Tegner in the beginning of the 20th century.  A second application was music performance, where musician Larf Frydén, Anders Friberg and I developed a digital performance grammar that controlled a synthesizer; thus, the synthesizer performed music examples in accordance with a set of performance rules. A third area has been the singing voice, the purpose being to explore how various acoustic properties affect the sound of a singer’s voice.

Johan Sundberg (born in 1936, Ph.D. in musicology Uppsala University 1966, doctor honoris causae 1996 University of York, UK) has a personal Chair (Emeritus) in Music Acoustics at the department of Speech Music and Hearing (KTH), Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. He early became interested in the acoustical aspects of music, starting with a doctoral dissertation work on organ pipes. After the dissertation, singing voice and music performance have been his main research topics. He led the music acoustics research group from 1970 to 2004. In Musikens Ljudlära (The science of Musical Sounds) Sundberg presents music acoustics in popularized form to the interested layman. In Röstlära (The Science of the Singing Voice) Sundberg explains functional anatomy as well as vocal acoustics. Both texts have been seminal works in the field of voice science.

2. [Ed Newton-Rex, TikTok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-newton-rex): *From Lab to Market: Building AI Composition Products*
> AI composition has come a long way, and the technology is starting to write convincing music. But to what end? Technology serves little purpose if it isn't used. In this talk, we look at the range of products that AI composition technology has been applied to, what some of the pitfalls are when moving from research to product development in this nascent field, and what to think about when designing AI composition products.

2. [Henry Adam Svec, University of Waterloo](http://www.henryadamsvec.ca) *“Gonna Burn All My Bridges”: LIVINGSTON’s Artificially Intelligent Folk Songs of Canada and an Alternative Way Forward in A.I. Research*
> Decades of discovery in the field of artificial intelligence have prioritized intelligence as the lodestar of research and development. What if folkloristic authenticity was substituted as the guiding goal of our collective labours? In this playful performance, involving both storytelling and song, Henry Adam Svec will explore this and other questions through the recounting of a most unlikely scenario—the time when, in Dawson City, Yukon, he co-invented the world’s first artificially intelligent database of Canadian folksong.
2. [Professor Sven Ahlbäck, KMH + DoReMIR](https://scorecloud.com) *What does AI learn from music?: On the problem of ground truth in music and the power of concepts*
> Many AI applications on music relates to music theoretical models, in the sense of musical concepts and ideas of how music works, that are not always made explicit, explicitly discussed or questioned. Already the choice of representations of music and sound as well as the selection of data for training models can influence models and creative output greatly. Here we will give some examples of problems arising when modelling basic musical features, from the experience of developing  automatic music notation.

# Tutorials

1. Samuel Hunt (UWE Bristol, UK): This tutorial introduces participants to the [Interactive Generative Music Environment (IGME)](http://samhunt.panel.uwe.ac.uk/) and demonstrates the ease at which generative music compositions can be created, without domain specific knowledge of either generative music or programming constructs. IGME attempts to bridge the gap between generative music theory and accessible music sequencing software, through an easy to use score editing (or piano roll) interface. IGME is available free of charge and works on Windows and Mac OS. It is hoped that participants will learn about generative music so that they understand how to utilize them in their own composition practice. [Link](https://ca.bbcollab.com/guest/a818ce90b182432b9f8f8fe0f0bb8430) to tutorial.
2. Bob L. T. Sturm (KTH, Sweden): This tutorial introduces participants to AI-generated folk music through practice. Two AI-generated folk tunes will be taught aurally and discussed. Participants should be comfortable with their musical instrument of choice and be able to learn by ear (but music notation will be provided). The two tunes will be taught gradually by repeating small phrases and combining them to form the parts. Sturm will lead the session with his accordion. <a href="MFtunes.pdf" download>Here's the tunebook.</a>
