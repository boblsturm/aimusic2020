The 2020 Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity brings together for the first time two overlapping research forums: [The Computer Simulation of Music Creativity conference (est. 2016)](https://csmc2018.wordpress.com/), and [The International Workshop on Musical Metacreation (est. 2012)](http://musicalmetacreation.org/). The principal goal is to bring together scholars and artists interested in the virtual emulation of musical creativity and its use for music creation, and to provide an interdisciplinary platform to promote, present and discuss their work in scientific and artistic contexts.

The computational simulation of musical creativity continues to be an exciting and significant area of academic research, and is now making impacts in commercial realms. Such systems pose several theoretical and technical challenges, and are the result of an interdisciplinary effort that encompasses the domains of music, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and philosophy. This can be seen within the broader realm of Musical Metacreation, which studies the design and use of such generative tools and theories for music making: discovery and exploration of novel musical styles and content, collaboration between human performers and creative software “partners”, and design of systems in gaming and entertainment that dynamically generate or modify music.

The 2020 Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity will consist of synchronous and asynchronous events. The five-day program will feature tutorials, research paper presentations, discussion panels, an online exhibition, invited spotlight presentations and two keynotes delivered by [Professor Emeritus Dr. Johan Sundberg (Speech, Music and Hearing, KTH)](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UXXUEcoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Alice Eldridge (Music, Sussex University, UK)](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p127749-alice-eldridge).

We encourage submissions of papers, tutorials, panels and musical works on topics related to CSMC and MuMe, including, but not limited to, the following:

_Systems_

* systems capable of analysing music
* systems capable of generating music 
* systems capable of performing music 
* systems capable of (online) improvisation
* systems for learning or modeling music style and structure
* systems for intelligently remixing or recombining musical material
* systems in sound synthesis, or automatic synthesizer design
* adaptive music generation systems
* music-robotic systems
* systems implementing societies of virtual musicians
* systems that foster and enhance the musical creativity of human users
* music recommendation systems
* systems implementing computational aesthetics, emotional responses, novelty and originality
* applications of CSMC and/or MuMe for digital entertainment: sound design, soundtracks, interactive art, etc. 

_Theory_

* surveys of state-of-the-art techniques in the research area
* novel representations of musical information
* methodologies for qualitative or quantitative evaluation of CSMC and/or MuMe systems
* philosophical foundations of CSMC and/or MuMe
* mathematical foundations of CSMC and/or MuMe
* evolutionary models for CSMC and/or MuMe
* cognitive models for CSMC and/or MuMe
* studies on the applicability of music-creative techniques to other research areas
* new models for improving CSMC and/or MuMe
* emerging musical styles and approaches to music production and performance involving the use of CSMC and/or MuMe systems 
* authorship and legal implications of CSMC and/or MuMe
* future directions of CSMC and/or MuMe

# Registration
