* Demonstrations (3 pages maximum, not including references).Â 

All papers must use the <a href="templates_aimusic2020.zip" download>mandatory template for the conference</a>, and be submitted through [EasyChair](http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csmcmume2020).

Submissions do not have to be anonymized. Each submission will receive at least three reviews. All papers should be submitted as complete works. Demo systems should be tested and working by the time of submission, rather than be speculative. We encourage audio and video material to accompany and illustrate submitted papers. We ask that authors arrange for their web hosting of audio and video files, and give URL links to all such files within the text of the submitted paper. 

Accepted full papers will be published in a proceedings with ISBN 978-91-519-5560-5.

Selected papers will be invited for expansion and consideration for publication in the Journal of Creative Music Systems.
