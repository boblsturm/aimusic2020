We solicit entries for consideration for an online exhibition during the conference, similar in format to the one organized at the [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Machinee Learning for Creativity and Design](http://www.aiartonline.com/category/music-2019).

Submitted works (video, audio) can be of any style, but must involve the use of computational creativity techniques. Examples include, but are not limited to: reproduction of musical style using machine learning; the evolution of musical structures using interactive genetic algorithms; rule-based systems; systems based on emergence or self-organization; systems that perform music data mining to create remixes, and so on.

Submissions should not be sketches but in their final format and will be judged on their presentability as an online experience. Submissions should not be anonymised.

Please submit the following to [Mattias Sk√∂ld](mailto:maskold@kth.se):
* a link to the work you wish to present (in its final form)
* an A4-portrait PDF, up to 2 pages, describing your work and the system you are using, and explaining how it relates to the focus of the conference
* a link to any additional documentary material such as audio or video recordings, or online software before the submission deadline

All submissions will be reviewed by independent members of the music selection committee. Once these reviews have been completed the reviewers and the chairs will discuss the submission, and make a final decision. Reviewers will be anonymous to the authors, but not to each other. The final decision lies with the chairs, in consultation with the committee.
