# The 2020 Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity 

Oct 19-23 2020 hosted virtually by the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden 

[Call for papers, tutorials and panels](https://boblsturm.github.io/aimusic2020/#CFP)
[Call for musical works](https://boblsturm.github.io/aimusic2020/#CFM)

The 2020 Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity brings together for the first time two overlapping research forums: The Computer Simulation of Music Creativity conference (est. 2016), and The International Workshop on Musical Metacreation (est. 2012). The principal goal is to bring together scholars and artists interested in the virtual emulation of musical creativity and its use for music creation, and to provide an interdisciplinary platform to promote, present and discuss their work in scientific and artistic contexts.

The computational simulation of musical creativity continues to be an exciting and significant area of academic research, and is now making impacts in commercial realms. Such systems pose several theoretical and technical challenges, and are the result of an interdisciplinary effort that encompasses the domains of music, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and philosophy. This can be seen within the broader realm of Musical Metacreation, which studies the design and use of such generative tools and theories for music making: discovery and exploration of novel musical styles and content, collaboration between human performers and creative software “partners”, and design of systems in gaming and entertainment that dynamically generate or modify music.

The 2020 Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity will consist of synchronous and asynchronous events. The five-day program will feature tutorials, research paper presentations, discussion panels, an online exhibition, invited spotlight presentations and two keynotes delivered by Professor Emeritus Dr. Johan Sundberg (Speech, Music and Hearing, KTH) and Dr. Alice Eldridge (Music, Sussex University, UK).

## [Call for papers, tutorials, panels](#CFP)

We encourage submissions of papers, tutorials and panels on topics related to CSMC and MuMe, including, but not limited to, the following:

_Systems_
* systems capable of analysing music
* systems capable of generating music 
* systems capable of performing music 
* systems capable of (online) improvisation
* systems for learning or modeling music style and structure
* systems for intelligently remixing or recombining musical material
* systems in sound synthesis, or automatic synthesizer design
* adaptive music generation systems
* music-robotic systems
* systems implementing societies of virtual musicians
* systems that foster and enhance the musical creativity of human users
* music recommendation systems
* systems implementing computational aesthetics, emotional responses, novelty and originality
* applications of CSMC and/or MuMe for digital entertainment: sound design, soundtracks, interactive art, etc. 

_Theory_
* surveys of state-of-the-art techniques in the research area
* novel representations of musical information
* methodologies for qualitative or quantitative evaluation of CSMC and/or MuMe systems
* philosophical foundations of CSMC and/or MuMe
* mathematical foundations of CSMC and/or MuMe
* evolutionary models for CSMC and/or MuMe
* cognitive models for CSMC and/or MuMe
* studies on the applicability of music-creative techniques to other research areas
* new models for improving CSMC and/or MuMe
* emerging musical styles and approaches to music production and performance involving the use of CSMC and/or MuMe systems 
* authorship and legal implications of CSMC and/or MuMe
* future directions of CSMC and/or MuMe

### Submission formats
_Papers_
All papers must use the [mandatory template for the conference](https://github.com/boblsturm/aimusic2020/blob/master/templates_aimusic2020.zip), and be submitted through the EasyChair submission link: [http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csmcmume2020](http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=csmcmume2020).

There are three formats for paper submissions:
* Full papers (8 pages maximum, not including references)
* Work-in-progress papers (5 pages maximum, not including references)
* Demonstrations (3 pages maximum, not including references). 

Submissions do not have to be anonymized. Each submission will receive at least three reviews. All papers should be submitted as complete works. Demo systems should be tested and working by the time of submission, rather than be speculative. We encourage audio and video material to accompany and illustrate submitted papers. We ask that authors arrange for their web hosting of audio and video files, and give URL links to all such files within the text of the submitted paper. 

Accepted full papers will be published in a proceedings with ISBN 978-91-519-5560-5.

Selected papers will be invited for expansion and consideration for publication in the Journal of Creative Music Systems. 

**Important dates for paper submission**
* Paper submission deadline: August 14 2020 
* Paper notification: September 18 2020 
* Camera-ready paper deadline: October 2 2020 

_Panels_
Please contact the panel chair [Oded Ben-Tal](mailto:obental@gmail.com).

_Tutorials_
Please contact the tutorial chair [xyz](mailto:xyz@gmail.com).

## [Call for musical works](#CFM)

We solicit entries for consideration for an online exhibition during the conference, similar in format to the one organized at the [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Machinee Learning for Creativity and Design](http://www.aiartonline.com/category/music-2019).

Submitted works (video, audio) can be of any style, but must involve the use of computational creativity techniques. Examples include, but are not limited to: reproduction of musical style using machine learning; the evolution of musical structures using interactive genetic algorithms; rule-based systems; systems based on emergence or self-organization; systems that perform music data mining to create remixes, and so on.

Submissions should not be sketches but in their final format and will be judged on their presentability as an online experience. Submissions should not be anonymised. 

_Submission process_
Please submit the following to The Music Chair [Mattias Sköld](mailto:maskold@kth.se)
* a link to the work you wish to present (in its final form)
* an A4-portrait PDF, up to 2 pages, describing your work and the system you are using, and explaining how it relates to the focus of the conference
* a link to any additional documentary material such as audio or video recordings, or online software before the submission deadline

**Selection process**
All submissions will be reviewed by independent members of the music selection committee. Once these reviews have been completed the reviewers and the chairs will discuss the submission, and make a final decision. Reviewers will be anonymous to the authors, but not to each other. The final decision lies with the chairs, in consultation with the committee.

# Registration
At least one author of each accepted submission should register for the conference by Sep. 25, 2020. Papers without registered authors will be withdrawn. Please check the conference website for details on registration.
